    <h4>Vanshika <br> 
        When I say “I love you,” I mean it in the deepest sense. <br>
         It’s not just about how I feel right now but about how I see us moving forward together. <br>
          To me, love means caring for you, supporting you through every high and low, and always wanting the best for you. <br>
         It’s about being there not just in the good times but in the difficult moments. <br>
"I love you" means I see you for who you truly are—your strengths, your vulnerabilities, your quirks—and <br>
 I accept all of it wholeheartedly. It’s about wanting to make you smile, <br>
  to be someone you can count on, and to grow alongside you as we navigate life together. <br>
I hope that in time, you’ll feel ready to say those three magical words to me too. <br>
Hearing them from you would mean the world to me, <br> but I understand that you might need time, <br>
and I’m more than willing to wait.
<br>
Just know that my feelings for you are genuine, <br>
I’ll be here whenever you feel ready to share yours. <br><br>
