    <h4>Vanshika <br> 
        First, I want to thank you for being so open with me about your feelings and your past. <br>
         I understand that you've been through a lot, and it takes courage to share that. <br>
        I want you to know that I respect your experiences and the fact that you might be cautious because of them. <br>
That said, I care about you deeply, and I believe that not all relationships have to be the same. <br>
 I would really appreciate the chance to show you that not all guys are the same either. <br>
  I promise to be someone who respects you, cares for you, and always has your best interests at heart. <br>
   I’d love the opportunity to prove to you that I can be different—someone you can trust, lean on, and feel safe with.<br>
At the same time, I don’t want to rush or push you into anything you’re not ready for. <br>
 We can take things as slow as you need, and I’ll be here for you regardless of where this goes. <br>
  But I truly hope you’ll give me a chance to show you what I can offer. <br>
No matter what, our friendship means a lot to me, and I’ll always value it.
<br><br>
